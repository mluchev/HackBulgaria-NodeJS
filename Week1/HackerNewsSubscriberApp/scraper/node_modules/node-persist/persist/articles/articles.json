We have an mainly internal-only app that I work on that started out as PHP+HTML+CSS only and then over the years JS has been bolted on in various places. At first it was just to make life easier (Autocomplete, minor AJAX) but now we have entire components that will not function without JS and could not function without JS. Recently some devs have pushed for supporting browsers without JS enabled and I have been vehemently against it for a couple reasons:<p>1) MAJOR parts of our app will not and can not work without JS. Period, exclamation point.<p>2) Because of point 1 it doesn&#x27;t make sense to waste dev time on making some views work with&#x2F;without JS (We are a younger company and don&#x27;t have time to waste on something like this especially when it isn&#x27;t public-facing, not to mention QA can&#x27;t handle testing everything twice).<p>3) Even if V1 of a component does support both JS and no JS there is no guarantee that future updates will be able to keep feature-parity or have time to code for that.<p>For me JS is part of the web, not an optional add-on.

And if you can find things in the existing document that you feel give people a false sense of security, please let us know and we can try to fix them.<p>I realize that there&#x27;s a pretty serious risk that any security guide will make people feel like they &quot;did the right thing&quot; and are communicating safely, then still get compromised.  We are always struggling with the pull of &quot;privacy nihilism&quot; that would lead people to simply use plaintext communications over the Internet and GSM network because there are (for example) vulnerabilities in their OS or baseband, or because most encryption tools don&#x27;t protect metadata.  It&#x27;s challenging to know what to say about risk when surveillance is a multi-billion-dollar industry and a lot of very smart people have made an entire career out of it.<p>One point of view is that a lot of the mitigations really need to come from the platform developers, so desktop and mobile OSes need to ship with more crypto out of the box, turned on by default, in the default communication tools, etc., and hire a lot more vulnerability researchers.  If you favor that point of view, I definitely encourage you to try to push things along from that direction too!","time":1414090705,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eff-relaunches-surveillance-self-defense"},{"by":"rthomas6","id":8500041,"kids":[8500475],"parent":8499784,"text":"No... that&#x27;s not really the effect of no rent control. In fact rent control is often the cause of excessive credit checks, proof of employment, etc. Maybe in the short run no rent control would make disproportionate high rents, but not in the long run. In fact it&#x27;s the opposite. No rent control results in something like Hong Kong: abundant, extremely tiny apartments that people can afford. That may not be ideal, but it&#x27;s certainly better than being homeless.<p>Luxury apartments are lucrative, sure, but if you can fit more rooms into a given space you can often make even more money.

These programs already don&#x27;t receive enough attention and support.<p>This is the intended consequence, not a side-effect.<p>Cities want to reduce their homeless population, because it&#x27;s distasteful and discourages consumers in those areas. The place I grew up in gentrified rapidly over the course of the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s and homeless people made the rich whites that wanted to go to the starbucks feel uncomfortable. On a large scale this would hurt the economy.<p>A city in this situation has two options. They can treat the underlying causes of homelessness, build more affordable housing, spend more on mental health, etc. But this is expensive and takes money out of the economy at both ends, because you can always make affordable housing unaffordable and collect more property tax and income tax from the new residents.<p>So, the city went with the cosmetic option: Make it extremely difficult to be homeless within the areas the city wanted homeless people gone from. This entails a number of very cheap, but very effective changes to the environment to just make it difficult for homeless people to be around:<p>* They installed bars on benches, so that nobody could sleep on them, and encouraged property owners to install spike strips in doorways so that homeless people couldn&#x27;t sleep there.<p>* They installed &quot;help the homeless&quot; parking meters so that people could &quot;give their change to the homeless&quot; (really, give their money to a charity, that would have overhead, administrators to pay, etc., resulting in much less going to homeless people), and made it illegal to panhandle and to give money to pandhandlers.<p>* They made it illegal to serve food without a license, criminalizing Food Not Bombs (a group that collects and distributes food for free, for everyone, not just homeless people) and also giving food directly to homeless people.<p>* The few homeless people that remained in the area after they left were harassed by police and driven out directly.<p>At the same time this was going on, the city was closing shelters and selling the land to developers.<p>Writ large, no city has any incentive to actually address homelessness when it could just try to drive homeless people out of its borders and make it Not Their Problem.

And I think we can all agree that the status quo is not so great.  So, what types of things do you want to encourage?  Well, we&#x27;d want to encourage homeless people to do things like get actual healthy meals that are appropriate for their medical needs, get involved in jobs programs, get health screenings, and have safer places to sleep at night.  How do you get these things?  Well, you do it by encouraging the homeless to get involved with institutions that provide these programs on a wide-scale basis.  When you do that you get information about how effective or ineffective the programs are about improving the quality of lives of the homeless as well as potentially even moving them out of homelessness altogether.  It would be nice if people could all be rational actors, have this explained to them, and when they see a homeless person they could perhaps direct them to the local facility that is best equipped to handle their specific needs.  But you know what?  Experience tells us that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  That&#x27;s why the law gets involved and does things like make panhandling and giving out food in city parks illegal.  You say you don&#x27;t have all the answers, but what you are saying is that you do have an answer: the status quo.  It may not be perfect but it definitely stands to reason that getting the homeless directly involved with professional organizations that intend to help them is <i>likely</i> going to be better for everyone in the long run than putting the homeless in the very precarious position of having to panhandle for money or food from complete strangers who generally will have no idea how to actually help homelessness.","time":1414091863,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"by":"yegor256a","id":8500140,"score":1,"time":1414091882,"title":"How We Write a Product Vision","type":"story","url":"http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/20/how-we-write-product-vision.html?2014-42"},{"by":"aaron-lebo","id":8500141,"kids":[8500940],"parent":8499632,"text":"You hit on something interesting here.<p>With a few exceptions, everyone on this site experienced childhood without the barrage of information and sensations that is the Internet.<p>It is scary to imagine how children who from birth have been trained to always look for entertainment through iPad games and the need to always be connected - how that might affect them.

And because Ulbricht allegedly violated the company’s terms of service by using its computers to deal in narcotics and other contraband, that company was exempted from any obligation to protect his privacy.</i><p><i>Finally, prosecutors argue that for the 30-year-old Texan to claim privacy protections for Silk Road’s server, he would have to declare that it belonged to him—a tricky Catch-22. Ulbricht hasn’t claimed personal possession of that computer’s data, as doing so would almost certainly incriminate him. But because he hasn’t he can’t claim that his privacy was violated when it was searched, according to the prosecutor’s reasoning. “Because Ulbricht has not submitted any affidavit alleging that he had any possessory interest in the SR Server—let alone one that would give him a reasonable expectation of privacy—his motion should be denied,” reads the prosecutors’ filing.</i><p>Or maybe the decision by a US Magistrate Court which said private information is fair game, even if its located on servers in other countries, given a valid search warrant.

The only difference is that with Javascript I can intercept the action and make the state change a lot more streamlined, or add a fancy animation if I so desire.<p>By simply intercepting buttons and links (similar to how pjax and turbolinks work) I don&#x27;t have to dig through JS to find where a specific AJAX request is fired-off and what it does. It just works, and when it returns, it simply updates part or all of the page with whatever the server returned, which could be part or all of a page.<p>There are, of course, obvious limitations, like local state that changes with user interaction but that isn&#x27;t preserved on the server in any way. But the more I can get working without Javascript, the more I know will be easily maintainable and translatable going forward even if I do something crazy like get rid of jQuery or convert everything to a React app.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a bit odd, but I find this approach a lot easier to manage and a lot more productive in the long run than in marrying myself to any particular client-side framework.","time":1414093179,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://thewebitsforeveryone.tumblr.com/"},{"by":"dang","id":8500272,"kids":[8500359],"parent":8499937,"text":"Since that announcement is (a) a more original source, (b) arguably more substantive, and (c) doesn&#x27;t have a breathy title, we changed the url to it from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/10/23/weeks-after-winning-a-nobel-prize-for-his-microscope-eric-betzig-just-revolutionized-microscopy-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;speaking-of-science&#x2F;wp&#x2F;20...</a>.","time":1414093190,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.hhmi.org/news/new-microscope-collects-dynamic-images-molecules-animate-life"},{"by":"micampe","id":8500273,"parent":8500196,"text":"What a thoughtful and insightful remark.

They are investing their money in High Yield High Risk markets. And their track records and returns show this. They have funded 716 companies. 3 are worth north of $1BN. 20 are greater than $100M. [1] Their track record is amazing, but ~97% of the business&#x27;s they have invested in have not &quot;made it big&quot;, so to speak.<p>A good friend of mine owns a very successful real estate software company. At last estimate he is worth ~$300M. He started the company without traditional investors (his father did put in $10,000 to be fair), he owns the entire business himself. He has many &quot;things&quot;; cars, vacation homes, an island. He also has a wife and has very successfully raised 4 kids while building up his business.<p>The point I hope a few people can take away from all of this is that investors like YC and the like have one way of starting a business. It is successful for some, life changing for others, and entirely the wrong approach to business for yet a different group. There are many other ways to start a business, technical or not. grey-area, I am with you. It is not healthy to have a company consume you completely, and it is not necessary for a business to succeed.

Some of them are close personal friends.<p>As far as I can tell you want to see it made illegal to feed the homeless -- fair enough. However, there is nothing stopping the homeless from going to shelters or the city&#x2F;county&#x2F;state to get help right now. But without more resources for those programs there is very little that will change long-term.<p>If you are worried about exposing the homeless to programs I think it would be better for the police to have more mental health training, or a social worked they could call, or something similar. As far as I know, most of the soup kitchens around here already have a social worker on staff, but maybe they could have more available. The point is that I&#x27;m sure it could be improved, but making it illegal to street feed the homeless just isn&#x27;t the answer you seem to think it is.<p>As far as a solution to homelessness goes -- I don&#x27;t think there will ever be anything like a complete solution. However, I think putting a lot more money into social services and human development programs will help, as will directly funding shelters and government programs will be a tremendous help. But the best thing, the thing homeless people really need? People who actually care about them and try to directly help them. It&#x27;s about human contact. It&#x27;s about getting out and talking to them. Maybe I can&#x27;t solve their problems, but I can make it better for a little while. And sometimes that&#x27;s enough.","time":1414093705,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"deleted":true,"id":8500312,"time":1414093735,"type":"story"},{"by":"benoi","id":8500313,"score":1,"text":"","time":1414093753,"title":"Should I Retweet?

We lived in a cheap motel, 4 of us to the room. We had some hot plates and cooked some in the room and used the bathroom sink to wash up afterwards. It wasn&#x27;t too bad to be honest, we had food, shelter, clothing, jobs and each other.<p>We weren&#x27;t the only &quot;housing challenged&quot; residents of this motel. By the late night activity in the hallway and the parking lot, most seemed to have some kind of severe addiction problem, though there were a couple illegal immigrants who had secured a room through a friend while they worked for remittance money. On more than one occasion, drunk&#x2F;high people tried to force entry into our room later at night. My father slept by the door with a hammer after the second time.<p>Despite this, I&#x27;m not an authority on homelessness, but I know it sucks. For people like us, without severe mental, substance or family problems, wanting the make the sucking part stop is what kept us working on getting out of the situation. So I understand the ideas behind some of these notions around &quot;not encouraging&quot; people to be homeless. Having lived in those kinds of conditions before and not minded them terribly, to be perfectly honest, I&#x27;ve had moments where I&#x27;ve thought &quot;if I could have a room and food, without working at all, I wouldn&#x27;t bother looking for a job&quot;. So I fundamentally <i>get</i> where that&#x27;s coming from.<p>However, I also have several people in my family with severe psychological and addiction issues, and recognizing these same issues in the homeless I see out on the street every day, I understand that &quot;getting out of the suckiness of homelessness&quot; is not a major driver for them. Their hierarchy of needs is often screwed up and insomuch as they are able to satisfy that hierarchy, getting shelter (and even food) is often not a major priority for them. So no amount of having food kitchens or not having them is going to be a major decision point for them to suddenly come off their additions, become sane, and become productive members of society. However, I do think that people should be able to eat a safe meal if they need it.<p>Now that I&#x27;m long out of that situation, educated and affluent, I also suffer from NIMBYism. I worked very hard and have spent significant amounts of time and money to live in an area where I don&#x27;t really have to worry about the kinds of negative environmental factors and activities that come with handling large homeless populations. I don&#x27;t want a food kitchen anywhere near where I live. Not because I don&#x27;t believe in feeding the homeless, people need to eat <i>today</i> not after a six month job training program, but because for people who aren&#x27;t working their way out of homelessness, there are large numbers of negative issues that homeless people bring along with them and it contributes to an environment I don&#x27;t want to be in.<p>So this <i>is</i> a very tough issue. However, just offering services isn&#x27;t really a good answer either. When I spent some time in Portland, I was struck by the number and permanence of the homeless population there. It&#x27;s not a particularly great outdoor environment, but the large number of free services in the downtown area have created a more or less stable population of self-supporting homeless. The principle complaint residents I&#x27;ve spoken to have is that it&#x27;s great these services exist, but once they&#x27;ve been served, what&#x27;s next?<p>I&#x27;ve observed poor coordination among homeless service organizations. You go here for food, here for the shelter, here for blankets, here for a job, if you&#x27;re extremely lucky you might be getting medical&#x2F;psychological&#x2F;addiction care on a sporadic basis.<p>But what really needs to happen is a centralized &quot;get off the streets&quot; center. If a homeless person wants <i>any</i> services, they have to check in there and they <i>must</i> participate in all of the appropriate services proscribed to them. I&#x27;m also an advocate that they should immediately be working in return for the services. Every city has loads of work that needs doing, picking up litter, emptying public trash bins, park beautification, cleaning up graffiti, repainting bridges, filling in potholes, etc. In exchange a person who&#x27;s &quot;in the program&quot; should get 3 hot meals a day, a small dorm room with a door they can lock, free psych&#x2F;rehab&#x2F;basic medical clinic treatment. They should be scored on participation, and if they do well, move on to more advanced programs like finding rent-controlled&#x2F;shared housing, real jobs that pay money, mass-transit subsidies etc.<p>A friend of mine had a horrible experience and ended up in a battered women&#x27;s shelter with 3 kids. The program they put her on was better than any homeless program I&#x27;ve seen. Within weeks, she had a job, psych counseling for her and her kids, and in a couple months had moved out of the shelter and was splitting a town home with another woman from the program at hugely subsidized rent (based on how much she made at her job). Within a year they had found her a two bedroom apartment just for her family. This was for a person who had money in her bank account, work history and some job skills, and a sizable social network who helped her out during her ordeal with food, money and places to stay.<p>It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but I was surprised at how much better it was for her than for the homeless who don&#x27;t really have anything at all.","time":1414094069,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"by":"pillfill","id":8500357,"kids":[8501020],"parent":8500257,"text":"The news is that they are injecting it even when you have opted out of CNPI.<p>The disturbing part is a unique ID that follows you despite private browsing and across browsers.

Or, in a more nuanced look, Huxley&#x27;s book suffers an unfortunate dichotomy: the things that are bad are not realistic and the things that are realistic are not bad.<p>The legitimately dystopian part of <i>Brave New World</i> are often technical in nature—effectively mind control through drugs and a caste system propped up by genetic engineering. These don&#x27;t just require advances in technology but also a surprising level of social organization. Where <i>1984</i> feels like a continuous progression from a Soviet Union that never collapsed, these core parts of <i>Brave New World</i> comes of as discontinuous, a jump both socially and technically.<p>And without these extreme social and technical changes, it stops being a dystopia. If not for the eugenics, genetics and soma, it sounds like a nice place to live! Freer sex, freer entertainment, more automation, more leisure... It&#x27;s radical, certainly, but not in a bad way—a radical departure from our current almost Puritan work ethic and our obsession with certain abstractions (the poorly defined &quot;real vs superficial&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;the dignity of work&quot;¹...etc) sounds like just what we need.<p>I like giving people what they want, even if I think it&#x27;s shallow or superficial. Then again, I&#x27;ve never been one to treat hedonism as a bad word.<p>That cartoon people like to pass around really captures my thoughts—in a way that&#x27;s opposite to its intended message! It shows how some of the believable things in <i>Brave New World</i> are believable, but never shows why they&#x27;re <i>bad</i>. It just assumes, and ties into cultural ideas (like &quot;hard work is good&quot; or &quot;your life must have meaning&quot;) that many people don&#x27;t question. But it misses the mark because it ignores the parts that are <i>not</i> plausible but actually created the dystopian environment.<p>The cartoon (much more than the book itself) is also a bit grating because I sense some condescending overtones. &quot;Look at all those people who don&#x27;t care about the world but just distract themselves with popular entertainment. How shallow!&quot; Obviously you, the reader, do not belong to this group. And hey, I don&#x27;t disagree <i>per se</i>—I think most popular distractions <i>are</i> shallow and have much better alternatives—but I also think there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with enjoying them. I mean, I follow the news, I care about recent events and where does it get me? Nowhere. I guess I could vote² a bit better, but all it&#x27;s done is sour me on all major candidates. Is this meaningfully better than comfortable ignorance? No, but people tell me it is. And here I am.<p>Really, <i>Brave New World</i> minus the implausible bits and with a larger dash of individual freedom thrown in is pretty much as far from dystopian as it can get. Radical, certainly, and jarring—very different from our current social order—but fundamentally <i>good</i>. It feels like it&#x27;s just a few exaggerated risks thrown in to make leisure and entertainment seem crass and indolent. <i>1984</i>, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t feel all that different from my parents&#x27; tales about the Soviet Union.<p>I know which one <i>I&#x27;m</i> more afraid of!<p>footnotes<p>¹ I&#x27;ve always really disliked this phrase. It&#x27;s one part rationalization and one part a way to keep people down and working even if they don&#x27;t want to. Doing something menial or boring or easily automatable <i>just for the sake of working</i> is not my picture of dignity!<p>² Haha, no I can&#x27;t, because I&#x27;m not a citizen. So I&#x27;d have to become a citizen first. It doesn&#x27;t matter, but it <i>is</i> annoying.","time":1414094498,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html"},{"by":"runeks","id":8500399,"parent":8497303,"text":"&gt; [...] control which Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to the user and can delay or discard user’s transactions and blocks.<p>Bear in mind that we can detect when a node does this, by monitoring it, and measuring whether blocks or transactions are withheld, kind of like in this paper: <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/techreport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.kau.se&#x2F;philwint&#x2F;spoiled_onions&#x2F;techreport.pdf</a>","time":1414094501,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6079"},{"by":"chrsstrm","id":8500400,"kids":[8501023,8500960],"parent":8499549,"text":"I was looking for a text or pdf version to read offline and didn&#x27;t find one, so I compiled a pdf version here - <a href=\"https://cl.ly/040F1D072g08\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cl.ly&#x2F;040F1D072g08</a><p>Also, if the site&#x27;s dev is reading this, your print stylesheets still show the feedback link overlayed on the copy.","time":1414094506,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eff-relaunches-surveillance-self-defense"},{"by":"Ysx","id":8500401,"parent":8499907,"text":"What&#x27;s the thinking behind the red highlight?

The housemaker accepts to trade their labor for money because they also want things for which it is more profitable for the housemaker to build a house for money and then trade that money for what they want. The process of trading something with someone else for something you prefer results in what we call profit.<p>This also means when you say &quot;moneyless transactions like BitCoin&quot;, you&#x27;re mistaken; bitcoin is money. Money is any product for which there is a large enough network of people willing to accept that product as payment for labor. So the rise of BitCoin won&#x27;t decrease the exchange rate of money, because BitCoin will become money by definition, since it will be used by people to arbitrage their time in a profitable way as explained in the previous paragraph.<p>Then you say wealth will increase because machines can make things. But the more you have of something, the more its value goes down. This is supply and demand. So you don&#x27;t get automatic wealth just because machines can produce, for instance, a bunch of tires, and a bunch of cars, if there&#x27;s not enough people wanting those cars with tires to self-drive them around. That means customers will assign less value to tires and cars, as the overabundance of tires and cars drive their own prices down.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of WinCo, but if you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re more profitable than Walmart, then I should hope they drive Walmart out of business. I have no hatred for Walmart, mind you; but I do have a love for better things, and charging cheaper prices than competitors while making more money seems to me like a win-win for everyone involved. If WinCo&#x27;s business model really works, and yet it hasn&#x27;t displaced Walmart, and assuming what you say is true, then I&#x27;m lead to believe other forces (likely regulatory) are keeping this outcome from being brought about. I&#x27;d appreciate if you could educate me as to why WinCo stores aren&#x27;t popping up everywhere and displacing Walmart (or maybe they are and I&#x27;m ignorant).<p>I&#x27;m still having trouble understanding how you got so quickly to the conclusion that &quot;the solution that I see is to raise taxes&quot;. I also find it weird that you say things like &quot;the community makes nothing other than taxes&quot;. The community is constituted of people. People can make money by selling their labor. Why do they expect Valve to work for them? I&#x27;m confused.<p>Also when you talk about US&#x27;s high tax rates (70-90%) in its highest growth decades (1950s and 60s), you should make sure to mention that they also had more loopholes than we have today, which means in effect that companies in general were paying nowhere near the official tax rate in taxes (they were paying around 30%). See [1] for a page with links to the studies. This is one of the most common economics history fallacy floating around today.<p>Your analysis of spreading over GDP to the population don&#x27;t take into account the change effect; that once you do that, people&#x27;s behaviors change unexpectedly in a way that you can&#x27;t guarantee that the GDP will remain anywhere close to what it is. Numbers look into the past, not the future. The GDP now only means how much was produced given the variables in place. If the variables were different (eg. more income distribution) then the outcome would be different (either more or less, or the same for different reasons). But because Economics fails to produce falsifiable and reproducible theories, we can never know for sure. With that in mind, number gymnastics as you do it is baseless.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/21/krugmans-twinkie-defense/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailycaller.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;krugmans-twinkie-defense&#x2F;</a>","time":1414095286,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/10/technology-and-productivity"},{"by":"digisign","id":8500494,"parent":8499185,"text":"As I may soon be maintaining some angular code and am new to it, I&#x27;m interested in your criticisms.

The homeless people I know are generally the kinder, gentler types -- down on their luck musicians, artists, more intellectual types. I tend avoid anyone who is violent or &quot;scammy&quot;.<p>This is just my opinion, based my my limited experience. And  homelessness is a big problem, so there will be a lot of different approaches. But I see it as primarily a problem of mental health. A lot of the homeless I know were abused, or came from shitty families, or had abusive parents, or any of a number of major childhood issues and their families didn&#x27;t have the financial or emotional resources to do anything about it. So I tend to see &quot;get tough on the homeless&quot; programs as blaming the victim. I think that forcing people to go into any kind of program or shelter or whatever is just going to lead to resentment and more problems in the long run. Most shelters are pretty bad already, and that&#x27;s with people who want to be there. Imagine how bad it&#x27;ll be with people who really don&#x27;t want to be there.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to keep people accountable -- E.g. Insist that if they want to be in a clean, decent shelter for three months and get meals then they need to make thrir bed, do dishes, go to group meeting daily and look for work, or see a doctor or psychiatrist, etc...<p>What I think they really need is a long-term program for re-integrating into society, sort of like prisoners getting out, one that includes basics like a place to live for a year or two, health care, food, as well as psychological care and job training. Many will be helped by that, but not all. Hopefully, people from the local community or church or something will be involved as well. It&#x27;s also important that there be a self-help group sort of like AA, but geared for the homeless, &quot;homeless anonymous&quot;, where people could talk openly about their life and experiences and be with others who have been through similar things.","time":1414096087,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"by":"spitfire","id":8500565,"parent":8500361,"text":"More than that.

The Soviet Union gravitated towards the totalitarian state it was, but at that time, it wouldn&#x27;t have been crazy to imagine a government (imagine a less jingoistic Germany, with all the creativity and efficiency), creating something very much like what Huxley envisions. In fact, had the West not had the ongoing competition with the totalitarian Soviet Union, the capitalist impulses could have merged with a much larger government, and the United States, or Continental European powers could have turned into something like that. Constant conflict both militarily and ideologically may have been the only thing that prevented it.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also a bit grating because I sense some condescending overtones. &quot;Look at all those people who don&#x27;t care about the world but just distract themselves with popular entertainment. How shallow!&quot; Obviously you, the reader, do not belong to this group.<p>You may be right, but that&#x27;s probably not fair to Huxley. In writing his book, he was speaking directly to his readers, trying to convince them that they were not so different from the utopia which he mocks.<p>&gt; And hey, I don&#x27;t disagree per se—I think most popular distractions are shallow and have much better alternatives—but I also think there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with enjoying them. I mean, I follow the news, I care about recent events and where does it get me? Nowhere. I guess I could vote² a bit better, but all it&#x27;s done is sour me on all major candidates. Is this meaningfully better than comfortable ignorance? No, but people tell me it is. And here I am.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing. At that stage, you have two choices. Either realize that our societies are flawed and struggle to do something about it, whether you can turn the tide or not, or take the soma, act like the world is okay (in the West, or own small worlds often are perfectly fine), and do nothing. What is disconcerting about our society, and similar to Brave New World, is apathy and consumerism have caused a lot of people (not necessarily you), to fall into the latter column, which could very easily lead to 1984.","time":1414097965,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html"},{"by":"ww520","id":8500718,"kids":[8500782],"parent":8499401,"text":"Looks good.

But don&#x27;t take my word for it, read the article and listen to people who live this every day and are also advocates.<p>Second, you&#x27;ve developed one heck of a straw man. I don&#x27;t know where people think this law says you &quot;can&#x27;t feed&#x2F;help the homeless&quot;. It never says that. It makes it illegal to reward destructive behavior patterns.

Nobody is throwing money at the state, nobody is getting a &quot;fix&quot;. In fact, this places more burden upon people to take it upon themselves to support their local organizations, and places a heavier burden on those organizations (because now they have more people to feed! which is an excellent problem to have, because now we have people seeking real help, instead of just trying to make it through the day!).<p>I appreciate your gracious hints, but I highly recommend you see the problem for yourself instead of relying on knee jerk reactions and the top google result.","time":1414100230,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"by":"kyrra","id":8500896,"parent":8500719,"text":"I see this as well.\nAT&amp;T LTE with iPhone 5 (running 8.1).","time":1414100235,"type":"comment","storyUrl":""},{"by":"pistle","id":8500897,"parent":8500790,"text":"Let&#x27;s say $1000 each (though this skews low and makes the units moved a generous number)<p>$1000 x 1000 = $1M\n900 x 1000 = 900,000 units moved<p>Since I&#x27;m going to guess they include SP3 accessories in this and that can increase average cost something like 20%, let&#x27;s drop that sales number down a load and say 500k-700k, likely closer to 700k.<p>Apple moved &gt;12M iPads last quarter for context.<p>I really like my SP3 as a main daily machine and think many people will slide into usage of such a device if they start acclimating to cloud storage and&#x2F;or more enterprise orgs start doing private cloud.<p>If MS can ride the &quot;private&quot; cloud story into the enterprises where they already have servers, etc. they could provide the better end-to-end story in the next 2-4 years for power tablets that most people from admin staff to executives could use well within the sweet spot of existing infrastructure.<p>Even if they can&#x27;t move hardware units, they are already firming up the enterprise software story by going more strongly into multi-platform support for Office, etc.","time":1414100254,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.microsoft.com/investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY15/Q1/default.aspx"},{"by":"simi_","id":8500898,"parent":8500891,"text":"Source: <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1980979\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phx.corporate-ir.net&#x2F;phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-new...</a>","time":1414100280,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/23/7052385/amazon-q3-2014-earnings"},{"by":"shawndumas","id":8500899,"score":1,"text":"","time":1414100291,"title":"Hackathon Guide -- A step-by-step guide","type":"story","url":"https://hackathon.guide/"},{"by":"bonzoq","id":8500900,"kids":[8501087],"parent":8499689,"text":"&gt;&gt; c. are in fact paying themselves a salary (and hiding it from investors?)\nDo you think all those founders don&#x27;t pay themselves salaries until the company becomes profitable?

That&#x27;s not even close to what depression is or how it works.  Depression isn&#x27;t when your life sucks so you feel bad, it&#x27;s when you feel bad for no reason, even when your life is objectively pretty good.  It&#x27;s a well documented medical phenomenon that can fortunately be managed rather well with, among other things, medication.  Comments like this, though, serve only to stigmatize treatment and actively discourage people from seeking help.<p>I have a close family member with depression.  They&#x27;ve been on Zoloft for a little over a year now and it has been a huge blessing.  The single biggest obstacle to getting them help was helping them overcome the social anxiety and sense of failure caused by stigmatizing and belittling attitudes like yours.<p>Yes, many more people are on antidepressants than in generations past.  Many more people also take antihistamines daily and get an annual flu shot and nobody thinks that signals some downfall of civilization.  Modern medicine has provided effective treatments for countless conditions, ranging from minor annoyances to debilitating illnesses, that previous generations had no alternative but to endure quietly.  In almost every area, save this one, this is rightly regarded as a triumph of science and a huge net good for humanity.

Instead CRC-32C, named after its designer Castagnoli, is probably the best choice:<p>CRC-32C is the algorithm that Intel implemented in its processors (&quot;CRC32&quot; SSE4.2 instruction). CRC-32C is also used by both ext4 and btrfs for bit rot detection. The first and most prominent user of CRC-32C was iSCSI.<p>Its mathematical definition (at least one of the most &quot;official&quot; definitions) is found in <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3720#section-12.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc3720#section-12.1</a> as a generator given in hex.

His work on an algebraic formalization of logic is foundational to the modern field of logic, which was the primary area of mathematic research (along with set theory) for the first three or so decades of the 1900&#x27;s. For example, the first chunk of Russel&#x27;s <i>Principia Mathematica</i> defines a new logical algebra to be used going forward.<p>It seems you think that the use of boolean algebra was popularized because of Shanon&#x27;s application of it to circuitry? Symbolic systems were well-used and well-known before that. For example, Goedel&#x27;s theorems (1929, 1931) deal explicitly with the symbolic representation of logical statements. And I daresay that the Incompleteness Theorem is something that Borges would have been intensely interested in, since it deals with the finite accessibility of knowledge.<p>In short, Borges would have chosen Boole because, at that time, it would have been perfectly acceptable to see his work on logic as being similarly foundational to the field of mathematics as that of Descartes (geometry) and Leibniz (calculus).","time":1414101148,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/03/18/290236647/an-imaginary-town-becomes-real-then-not-true-story"},{"by":"stephengillie","id":8500964,"kids":[8501026],"parent":8500433,"text":"I don&#x27;t know what automated process built that page, but Send to Kindle (for Chrome) just chokes and dies on it.

They aren&#x27;t a big secret or anything. A visit to the local Social Security office is about all it takes to get connected. Maybe the VA if your military. It can take a day or so, and be a real PITA, but nothing that&#x27;s super hard to manage. So the people who don&#x27;t get in these programs are mostly, for whatever reason,the types that don&#x27;t want to go.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say, because it&#x27;s an emotional thing, not a rational thing, but I think of it as two broad categories of resistance... I tend think of them as &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;content&quot;[1].<p>Some people have physical, structural problems with their brains -- they had a serious brain injury, a concussion, or stroke, or something; and they are functional enough to stay out of prison or not cause obvious problems, but their brain  is shot or they just can&#x27;t get themselves to focus for long enough to make any real headway with getting help on their own. I&#x27;d bet some just have ADHD, or some other organic&#x2F;structural problem with their brain.<p>Many of seem to have had a bad childhood, or a real bad experience at some point, and it left them feeling so poorly about themselves that they just expect the world to crap on them, like there is nothing they can do about it. They might descend into depression, or addiction, or spin off into some fantasy world, or deal with it in some other destructive way. I&#x27;ve noticed that the earlier things went wrong then the worse the effects seem to be, but this is strongly dependent on the person and what actually happened, and their current environment that it&#x27;s hard to say anything useful.<p>So that&#x27;s how I think about it, but what I do is to try to gently push people in the direction of getting help and making their life better, sometimes hold their hands, and not worry too much about who it is or their current situation in life. Sometimes I&#x27;m better than others, and I&#x27;m better with some people than others, so I don&#x27;t beat myself up if I can&#x27;t really help.<p>[1] Just to get a little philosophical - they aren&#x27;t really separate, just a useful way of thinking about what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;m a Buddhist, and the structure&#x2F;content idea helps me to see how my own mind works. For example, if I drink a lot of coffee and get really cranked up -- that&#x27;s more of a physical&#x2F;structural explanation of why I experience the world a certain way. If I have certain thoughts (&quot;I&#x27;ll never get this damn code right&quot;, or &quot;my life is crap&quot;) then that leads me to experience the world a certain way -- neither mean the world actually <i>is</i> that way.","time":1414101887,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless"},{"by":"alttab","id":8501012,"kids":[8501114],"parent":8500974,"text":"The quick answer is simply: don&#x27;t do it.

The books came out near each other and deal with similar themes, so they very often get compared to each other. But they are also significant and important books in isolation.<p>Yes, <i>BNW</i> is a better dystopia to live in than <i>1984</i>. But... it&#x27;s still a dystopia. Free thinkers are socially ostracized, personal preferences (outside a certain set) are ignored, personal destiny is decided at conception (one case where the world of <i>1984</i> is preferable).

As if &quot;actually only the second-worst dystopia in classic fiction&quot; is anything but damning.<p>Having a dystopia-off distracts from a significant part of the value that these works have to us as members of a society: There is more than one road to hell (and more than one hell to reach). <i>1984</i> shows an example of a possible future, why it is bad, and how it got that way. <i>BNW</i> shows an example of a very different future, why it is bad, and (less clearly) how it got that way. They give useful common ideas for possible outcomes of current actions. While <i>BNW</i> is preferable to <i>1984</i>, it still shows that avoiding a <i>1984</i> outcome as hard as you can is not enough because there are other ways that freedom can be destroyed. To simply say &quot;I would prefer my freedom be destroyed in one of these two ways&quot; is not the most useful thing one can take away from reading these two books.","time":1414105039,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html"},{"by":"xngzng","id":8501179,"score":1,"time":1414105067,"title":"New in Core Data and iOS 8: Asynchronous Fetching","type":"story","url":"http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/new-in-core-data-and-iOS-8-asynchronous-fetching/"},{"by":"CyberDildonics","id":8501180,"parent":8501161,"text":"Debunked?","time":1414105072,"type":"comment","storyUrl":"http://www.newsweek.com/assange-google-not-what-it-seems-279447"},{"by":"runjake","id":8501181,"kids":[8501198],"parent":8501161,"text":"Could you address specifically which parts you are referring to?
